Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Supervised Learning Approach
This project is part of an ongoing research initiative at Dublin Business School (DBS), focusing on Named Entity Recognition (NER) using supervised learning with spaCy.

Project Overview
The project implements a custom NER model trained using a supervised learning approach, requiring labeled data for identifying entities such as diseases and chemicals in medical texts. The model is trained and evaluated using spaCy's machine learning pipeline.

Features
✅ Supervised Learning-Based NER Model

Uses manually labeled training data for high accuracy.
Fine-tunes spaCy's transformer-based model.
✅ Custom NER Training Pipeline

Extracts entities from structured text.
Trains the model using spaCy's training loop.
✅ Model Evaluation with Confusion Matrix

Visualizes classification performance.
✅ NER Output with Colored Entity Highlighting

Displays detected entities in formatted output.
Installation

Usage
1. Running the Model in Jupyter Notebook
Open and execute ner_project.ipynb to:
✅ Load and preprocess data (from training.txt and test.txt).
✅ Train the model on labeled entities.
✅ Evaluate the model using a confusion matrix.
✅ Visualize Named Entity Recognition (NER) results on sample text.

2. Testing the Model on Sample Text
The trained model can be tested on custom text input:

Input: "Aspirin is often used to treat headaches and fever."  
Output: "Aspirin" → [CHEMICAL]  
         "fever" → [DISEASE]  
Model Evaluation
The confusion matrix below summarizes the model’s classification performance:
